Multiple imputation through statistical learning

The R package `misle` is built using TensorFlowâ„¢, which enables fast numerical computation and thus provides a solution for large-scale multiple imputation.



## Expected to be done in 2020
- implement multiple imputation by XGboost

- Simulation studies


   to show whether multiple imputation using statistical learning (machine learning) techniques will lead to statistical valid inference. 

- Visual diagnostics


   includes plotting functions for users to check whether the imputed values are sensible

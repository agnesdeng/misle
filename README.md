Multiple imputation through statistical learning

`misle` has been depreciated and it is now separated into the following packages

1. **mixgb**: multiple imputation through XGboost
2. **miae**: multiple imputation through auto-encoders including
- **midae**: multiple imputation by denoising autoencoders(with dropout)
- **mivae**: multiple imputation by variational autoencoders
3. **vismi**: Visualsation Tools for Multiple Imputation 

## mixgb
### multiple imputation through XGboost
Mixgb is now on CRAN and the newest version is on Github. For more details please check

## miae 
### multiple imputation through autoencoders

**Under development :)**
https://github.com/agnesdeng/miae
- Using torch R package (pytorch) instead of tensorflow
- Writing up documentation and vignette
- Pretune hyperparamters for imputers
- Visual diagnostic for imputation results

# misle
Multiple imputation through statistical learning

The R package `misle` is built using TensorFlow™, which enables fast numerical computation and thus provides a solution for large-scale multiple imputation.

`misle` is still at the early stage of development so lots of work have to be done before it is officially released. 

## Expected to be done in 2020
- **implement multiple imputation by XGboost**

- **Simulation studies**


   to show whether multiple imputation using statistical learning (machine learning) techniques will lead to statistical valid inference. 

- **Visual diagnostics**


   includes plotting functions for users to check whether the imputed values are sensible

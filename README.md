Multiple imputation through statistical learning

The R package `misle` is built using TensorFlowâ„¢, which enables fast numerical computation and thus provides a solution for large-scale multiple imputation.



## Expected to be done in the first half of 2020
-- Simulation studies 
to show whether multiple imputation using variational autoencoders and denoising autoencoders with dropout will lead to statistical valid inference. 

-- Visual diagnostics
to show users whether the imputed values are sensible
